        What's in this SaaS agreement? The fundamental obligation of the
        provider under the agreement is to make its software accessible to the
        customer via the internet as a service. The customer is granted a
        licence to use that software, subject to a set of restrictions and
        prohibitions that can be tweaked for each individual case. The provider
        may also be obliged to provide support services, and to ensure that it
        complies with certain requirements in relation to the maintenance of the
        software (for example, notice requirements). The data supplied by the
        customer are the property of the customer and, insofar as such data are
        personal data, are subject to a standard GDPR-friendly data processing
        clause. The customer data may be specified to be confidential. In
        consideration for the undertaking to provide the services, the customer
        agrees to pay to the provider the relevant charges and to ensure that
        the customer data will not create any liabilities on the part of the
        service provider. What legal documents do I need for my SaaS or cloud
        service? There are five main classes of document you should consider:
        terms of service; privacy policies; terms and conditions of website use;
        end user documents; and intra-customer and intra-user documents. First,
        you need terms of service – although they might be called something
        else. They might be called the "user agreement" or the "cloud service
        contract" or something different entirely. This SaaS agreement, our SaaS
        terms and conditions and our cloud services terms and conditions are all
        examples of terms of service documents. Whatever the document is called,
        its function is to regulate the legal relationship between a service
        provider and its customers. The terms of service will contain provisions
        covering the core services obligation, the payment of charges, the term
        of the contract and its termination, the parties' liability to one
        another, and so on. In some cases, the terms of service will be
        supplemented by additional subject-matter specific documents, such as
        data processing agreements and service level agreements. Second, you are
        likely to need a privacy policy. Privacy policies are used by
        organisations acting as data controllers to make disclosures to data
        subjects relating to the handling of personal data. Even if you are a
        processor with respect to much of the personal data in your database,
        you are likely to be a controller in some respects. For instance, you
        would usually be a controller of personal data in your customer
        relationship management system. See our free privacy policy for more.
        Third, if your website is not coterminous with your service, you will
        need terms and conditions to cover the use of the website. See our free
        website terms and conditions for more. Fourth, for many B2B services and
        for some B2C services, there may be users of the service who are not
        your customers and therefore not directly bound by the terms of service.
        In these cases, you may want to introduce additional documents which are
        binding upon both customers and non-customer users. Examples of this
        type of document include end user licence agreements and acceptable use
        policies. Fifth, a minority of SaaS and cloud services allow users to
        create contractual relationships with others – for example marketplaces
        for services, physical goods or digital goods. In some cases, it may be
        advantageous to provide standard documentation to govern these
        relationships. The documentation can be provided as mandatory or default
        documentation. In all cases, you should carefully circumscribe your
        liability in relation to the provision of any such documentation: you
        are not acting as your customers' lawyer. Who should prepare my SaaS or
        cloud agreement? The core SEQ Legal business is the sale and supply of
        templates. Nevertheless, we think that there are many circumstances
        where you should use a lawyer rather than a template legal document. In
        one sense a template isn't a substitute for a lawyer. Lawyers also work
        from precedents. By opting to use a template, you are taking on the
        lawyer's role. Before using a template, businesses should ask
        themselves: is the use of a lawyer commercially justified? Deciding
        whether it makes commercial sense will involve balancing risks and
        costs. Ask yourself the following questions. What are the risks
        associated with this contract? To what extent would a good lawyer help
        me to mitigate those risks? Do I have access to a lawyer with the right
        experience? Do I have access to appropriate templates? Will a lawyer
        help smooth the contracting process? What legal fees will I have to pay?
        How much time would it take me to prepare the document? Only by
        considering these and other relevant factors will you be able to make a
        sensible assessment. If you do decide to use a template, you should keep
        that decision under review. For example, it might make commercial sense
        to use a template for a new and untested service. However, if the
        service starts making significant amounts of money, you should engage a
        lawyer to review, advise on and update the document. How should I go
        about choosing a template document? Once you have decided to use a
        template for your cloud service or SaaS contract, you need to decide
        which template. There are three main aspects to suitability: execution
        style, structure and content. Execution style: will your document be
        agreed online or offline or both? How, specifically, will it be executed
        or agreed? Our SaaS agreement documents (including this free template)
        assume offline agreement, whereas our SaaS terms and conditions
        documents are agnostic, allowing for both online and offline agreement
        via a services order form. Our cloud services terms and conditions
        assume there will be an online sign-up process. Structure: will your
        document create a single contract with each customer, or could there be
        multiple contracts? In the case of a single contract, are different
        elements of the services independently terminable? Content: what is
        actually covered by your document? The types of clauses you might find
        in a long-form SaaS contract are listed below. Ensure that the template
        you choose covers all or most of the necessary subjects. Definitions of
        special terms Contract term and termination Set up / configuration
        services Development services Hosted / cloud services Support and
        maintenance Service levels Acceptance procedure Acceptable use Customer
        obligations, data and systems Mobile applications and other installed
        software Representatives, management and change control Charges,
        expenses, timesheets and payment processes Confidentiality and publicity
        Data protection Warranties and indemnities Limitations of liability
        Insurance requirements Force majeure Effects of contract termination
        Export restrictions Anti-corruption Non-solicitation / non-compete
        Contractual notices Subcontracting Assignment, waivers, severability,
        third party rights, entire agreement Law and jurisdiction Alternative
        dispute resolution How is liabillity limited in SaaS / cloud terms of
        service? The essence of cloud services is efficiency through
        standardisation: all customers using a single instance of an
        application, with uniform support and maintenance arrangements. This
        standardisation is reflected in the contractual sphere by the use of
        non-negotiable terms of service. Where terms of service are
        non-negotiable, they will usually say a good deal about the protection
        of the interests of the services provider, and relatively little about
        the protection of the interests of customers. However, if you run a
        small services provider selling to enterprise customers, you will know
        that even if an enterprise customer's procurement team are interested in
        purchasing a standard product, their legal team may be unwilling to
        accept standard legal documents. They will give particular attention to
        the provisions of your terms and conditions dealing with liability. In
        this category – liability provisions – I would include the following.
        Warranties, which assert that particular facts are true, and if proven
        false may ground a claim for damages. For example, a services provider
        may warrant that its software does not infringe any person's
        intellectual property rights. Limits of liability, which seek to reduce
        the amount of a claim in the event of a breach of warranty or another
        breach of contract. These may restrict recovery of particular types of
        loss (for instance, reputational damage) or losses arising from a
        particular cause (for instance, losses caused by third party services
        providers). In addition, they may apply one or more caps to the amounts
        which may be claimed. Commonly, such caps are set by reference to
        charges under the contract and/or available insurance coverage.
        Indemnities, which seek to extend the indemnifier's liability beyond
        that arising out of a breach of contract. For example, a services
        provider may be asked to indemnify the customer in relation to any
        allegations and claims that software infringes intellectual property
        rights, whether or not it does in fact infringe. The indemnifier will
        often seek control of any claims as a quid pro quo for this type of
        indemnity. What alternative SaaS-related legal documents are available?
        We publish a range of SaaS and hosted services contracts. Each document
        is available in two forms: as a downloadable MS Word template on Website
        Contracts, and as an online document in Docular. Using Docular, you edit
        the document online, and after editing download to your computer. You
        can download at any time in a variety of formats.
